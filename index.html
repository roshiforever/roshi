                        hope this message finds you well. I've taken some time to reflect on recent events, and I want to sincerely apologize for the hurt I've caused you. I recognize that my actions and words have deeply hurt you, and for that, I am truly sorry.

                            I want you to know that I understand the gravity of my mistakes, and I take full responsibility for the pain I've caused. I never intended for things to escalate the way they did, and I'm deeply regretful for any tears I may have caused.

                        You mean the world to me, and seeing you hurt is the last thing I want. I want to be the person who brings joy and support to your life, not the one who causes pain. I am committed to making amends and working on myself to ensure that I never repeat these mistakes.

                        I value our relationship immensely, and the thought of losing you is heartbreaking. I want to assure you that I love you deeply, and I am willing to do whatever it takes to make things right. I understand that trust may take time to rebuild, and I am patient and committed to earning that trust back.
                    </em>
